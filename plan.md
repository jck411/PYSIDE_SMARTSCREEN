The persistent settings issue has been fixed, with the application now correctly saving and loading settings when switching between screens. Here's an explanation of why we had these issues and what to look out for when implementing more settings in the future:

Why We Had Issues
Python-QML Interface Mismatch:

Python methods need proper @Slot annotations with return types to be accessible from QML
Without these annotations, QML can't call the methods even though they exist in Python
The SettingsManager methods weren't properly exposed to QML
Inconsistent Access Patterns:

Different components were trying to access settings in different ways
Some tried to use SettingsManager directly, others through ChatLogic
This inconsistency created synchronization problems
Missing Initialization Flow:

When components were created or screens changed, settings weren't always reloaded
The application lacked a consistent pattern for refreshing settings on screen transitions
Component Lifecycle Management:

QML components and Python objects have different lifecycles
When screens changed, new instances were created but weren't properly synchronized
What to Look Out For When Implementing More Settings
Proper Qt/QML Annotations:

Always use @Slot and @Property annotations for methods that QML needs to access
Specify return types (@Slot(result=bool)) for methods returning values
Consistent Data Flow:

Use a clear pattern: SettingsManager → Controller → Logic → QML
Always save settings through the SettingsManager to ensure persistence
Access settings through a consistent API
Component Initialization:

Initialize settings when components are created (Component.onCompleted)
Refresh settings when screens become visible (onVisibleChanged)
Use try/catch blocks to handle potential errors during initialization
Error Handling:

Always handle potential errors when accessing settings
Provide default values for all settings
Log errors for debugging purposes
Signal Propagation:

Use Qt signals to notify components when settings change
Connect to these signals to keep all parts of the UI in sync
By following these guidelines, future settings implementations should be more robust and avoid the synchronization issues we encountered.
